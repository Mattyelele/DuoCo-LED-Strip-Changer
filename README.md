# DuoCo-LED-Strip-Changer

Tool I made to change the colour of DuoCo LED strip using a Raspberry pi bluetooth. I used Raspberry pi bluetooth because I don't have a bluetooth card/dongle for me PC. Nothing good, it was something I made at like 2am because I was bored. I'm pretty sure it killed my LEDS so don't recommend using it unless you can fix it. I made a POC video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHGpMTO5ASM
